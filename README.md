# JSECT
A JavaScript library for easy handling of things like "Vectors, Directions, Lines, Rays... and more". The goal of the library is to provide common functions for calculating intersections, collisions, and distances between the types. Also provide some common functions that help with arrays and some math functions.

# Demo
The demo is a p5.js sketch. It has a ray and 2 lines. The ray is pointing at the mouse and shooting past the mouse. It is performing a raycast onto the two lines. The lines are hidden and the intersection point of the ray to the lines are being shows with a tiny circle that appears. The two lines cross and so this shows that the ray is hitting the closest point to the rays origin!
